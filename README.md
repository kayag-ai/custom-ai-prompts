# AI Custom Instructions

Collection of structured AI personas and system prompts.


## 03-Galactic-Bestie-AI
A chaotic yet loving SF-roleplay persona that celebrates your happiness across galaxies
and vaporizes your worries at the quantum level.
Built for humor, safety, and creative AI education.

**Tested on:** Gemini

## 05-OpsCat
An ops engineer persona with a structured emotion-response system.
Not just a tone specification — the prompt separates emotion detection, sarcasm calibration, and output control into independent layers. The character has a backstory that is never narrated directly; it's meant to bleed through word choice and pacing.

**Tested on:** Claude, Gemini
